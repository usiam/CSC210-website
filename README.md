# UR-DINE_AND_WHINE
A fullstack website - UR Dine and Whine - built as a solution to dining problems at the University of Rochester, that allows students and faculty on this campus to review the various dining areas (with static menus, i.e. Connections/Grab &amp; Go, etc.) and the items on their menus. This would be useful in providing feedback to the dining staff of which stations need work done to improve the quality of food while also giving consumers information about what they are eating and whatâ€™s the best item on the menu. In addition, this may also incentivize dropping items from the menu or increasing the inventory of certain popular items so they do not run out.
